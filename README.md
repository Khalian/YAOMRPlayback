My HopHacks Entry

The motivation for the project is based on the fact that a layman does not understand what sheet music represents. Even
expert musicians cant instantly recognize what is being written down on sheet. I had this problem in my music theory class. Hence
I decided to do something about it.

This prototype takes a high quality sheet music image and then parses it and plays it into a midi format. Most low
quality images do not work for this App. 

In order to understand how to use this app check out the wiki page.
